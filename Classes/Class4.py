"""
Create a card game!
User will receive two cards.  The combined value of the two cards will be compared to a random two cards (for a computer opponent).  Whoever has the highest combined value wins!

Part 1
- Create a Card class that includes lists of the standard cards
- For this game, Ace will only equal 11
- Face cards can equal 10 -OR- a number of your choice (below 13)
- You will need to determine the value of each card

Part 2
- Create a Hand class that will contain two Cards
- You will need to determine the value of your hand

Part 3
- Create a play() function that will display the users cards, an opponentâ€™s (computer) cards and declare a winner


*BONUS
- Create a Player class
- Allow each Player to have a Hand with two cards
- Tally wins and losses
- Adapt the play() function to handle the Player class
